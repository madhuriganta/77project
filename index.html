            Also known as a terminal or computer console, a console is a combination of a display monitor and an input device, typically a keyboard and/or mouse. It allows users to input commands and receive visual output from a computer or computer system. It is connected to another computer, server, or mainframe and is used to maintain or monitor the status of the network or computer.
